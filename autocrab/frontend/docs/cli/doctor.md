# `autocrab doctor`

Health checks + quick fixes for the gateway and channels.

## Examples

```bash
autocrab doctor
autocrab doctor --repair
autocrab doctor --deep
```

Notes:

- Interactive prompts (like keychain/OAuth fixes) only run when stdin is a TTY and `--non-interactive` is **not** set. Headless runs (cron, Telegram, no terminal) will skip prompts.
- `--fix` (alias for `--repair`) writes a backup to `~/.autocrab/autocrab.json.bak` and drops unknown config keys, listing each removal.
- State integrity checks now detect orphan transcript files in the sessions directory and can archive them as `.deleted.<timestamp>` to reclaim space safely.
- Doctor includes a memory-search readiness check and can recommend `autocrab configure --section model` when embedding credentials are missing.
- If sandbox mode is enabled but Docker is unavailable, doctor reports a high-signal warning with remediation (`install Docker` or `autocrab config set agents.defaults.sandbox.mode off`).

## macOS: `launchctl` env overrides

If you previously ran `launchctl setenv AUTOCRAB_GATEWAY_TOKEN ...` (or `...PASSWORD`), that value overrides your config file and can cause persistent “unauthorized” errors.

```bash
launchctl getenv AUTOCRAB_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl getenv AUTOCRAB_GATEWAY_PASSWORD

launchctl unsetenv AUTOCRAB_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl unsetenv AUTOCRAB_GATEWAY_PASSWORD
```
